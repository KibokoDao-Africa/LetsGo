## Revolutionizing Ticketing with Decentralized NFTs

## Problem and Proposed Solution

Traditional ticketing systems suffer from issues related to scalping, fraud, a lack of control for event organizers, operational inefficiencies, and limited transferability and ownership. These problems collectively contribute to a less-than-optimal experience for both event-goers and event organizers. A decentralized ticketing platform with NFT minting on the Flare Network seeks to address and overcome these challenges, offering a more secure, transparent, and user-centric solution.



## Market Opportunity

According to industry reports, the global event ticketing market is estimated to be worth approximately $67 billion in 2022. This figure encompasses various events, including concerts, sports, theater, and more.
The market has exhibited consistent growth over the years, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 7% over the past five years. This trend is primarily driven by increased spending on live events and the expanding cultural and entertainment industries.

## Technology Stack

By incorporating the Flare Network for NFT minting, robust security measures, decentralized storage through IPFS, and the scalability and reliability of Google Cloud services, we have built a technology stack that not only addresses the challenges of traditional ticketing systems but also offers enhanced security, transparency, and a seamless user experience for event organizers and attendees.


## Monetization

Our revenue streams encompass transaction fees, premium NFT features, and event promotions. We aim to provide transparent, cost-effective pricing for event organizers, while also offering value-added services to help them maximize ticket sales. Our pricing strategy is designed to ensure that both event organizers and our platform benefit from a mutually advantageous partnership


## Roadmap

In collaboration with the Kiboko DAO community, our roadmap is structured to foster community engagement, open-source development, and expansion into new markets. It emphasizes features like augmented reality ticket validation and advanced event analytics to provide a holistic and cutting-edge ticketing solution on the Flare Network. Together, we're building the future of event ticketing
